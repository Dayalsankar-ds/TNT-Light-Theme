/**
 * /services/crane-rental — Crane Rental's own page (2026-10-09). The first
 * service to get one, following the Maxim Crane comparison: an indexable URL
 * with its own title, and the quote form on the page rather than one click
 * away. Old /services#crane-rental links redirect here.
 *
 * Body: CraneRentalContent. This file adds the metadata and the quote
 * section — the same /contact form (ContactForm, service
 * preselected), so there is still one form and one submission path. Like
 * /contact, it says plainly that nothing is sent until a backend exists.
 *
 * Reached from: the homepage card, the nav's Services panel, the footer,
 * the /services card and crane preview (all via services.ts serviceHref).
