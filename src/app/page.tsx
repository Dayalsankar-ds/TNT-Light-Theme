// HERO REMOVED ENTIRELY 2026-09-23, on request (no more auto-scroll
// animation on the homepage). Unlike the 2026-09-18 hide (which left
// everything on disk), this deleted the hero outright: HeroVersioned.tsx,
// HeroScrollExperienceR3F.tsx, useHeroAutoScroll.ts, heroSequence.ts,
// HeroFamilyLogos.tsx, HeroFrameGL.tsx, HeroHeadline.tsx, the
// encode-hero-frames.sh/encode-hero-video.sh scripts, and every
// public/video/frames-v6/*.webp frame. The pre-R3F implementation is still
// further back in git history if ever needed: git show
// 5d89d04:src/components/HeroScrollExperience.tsx
//
// HERO REBUILT 2026-10-01, on request, from new footage — a from-scratch
// Hero.tsx, not a revival of the deleted files above. No scroll-scrub, no
// pin, no WebGL: a one-time, fully automated frame-sequence playback (578
// frames, new footage) that plays once per page load and stops on the last
// frame — see Hero.tsx's own docblock for the full spec and how it differs
// from the removed hero.
//
// FamilyStripV2 rendered directly as of 2026-09-13, on request. Nav version
// 1's FamilyStrip.tsx (the diagonal-panel + 2x2 grid design) and the "Nav
// 1/2" picker it was compared against were both deleted outright 2026-09-29,
// on request ("we are going with Nav Version 2") — see FamilyStripV2.tsx's
// own docblock for the fuller history.

/**
 * HOMEPAGE — the shortlisted Toyota-style arc (2026-07-27 trim, 21 → 9):
 * open cinematic → declare → what we do → catalog the machines (dark band) →
 * where we are → trust (iCARE) → prove it → convert. Everything
 * cut from here still ships on its own route (/about, /charts, /coverage,
 * /industries, /services, /careers, /for-sale, /contact) — the footer links
 * carry the secondary audiences.
 *
 * 2026-07-30: SafetyCulture (iCARE) added as a 10th section, between "prove
 * it" and "convert" — safety credentials land best immediately before the
 * ask, not earlier in the arc.
 *
 * 2026-08-21: SafetyCulture moved ahead of CaseStudies, on request — safety
 * credentials now land before the case-studies proof rather than after it.
 *
 * 2026-08-19: EquipmentGuide (Fleet Guide) moved to sit directly after
 * StatementSection, on request — the catalog now follows "who we are"
 * immediately.
 *
 * 2026-08-19 (later same day): CoreServices moved to sit directly after
 * StatementSection too, on request — it now lands ahead of Fleet Guide,
 * so "what we do" follows "who we are" before the equipment catalog.
 *
 * 2026-09-09: CoreServices moved back to sit immediately after
 * StatementSection (About Us) — Services now follows About Us directly.
 *
 * 2026-07-30 (later same day): a slim strip added right after the hero. First
 * built as CertificationsStrip (credential chips), but couldn't get real,
 * rights-cleared certification logos — repurposed as FamilyStrip instead:
 * TNT's own owned brand marks, no rights question. The certification chips
 * moved back to SafetyCulture, their original home — see that file's
 * docblock for the full back-and-forth.
 *
 * 2026-09-10: EquipmentFinder ("Find Your Machine") removed entirely, on
 * request — it used to sit here, between CoreServices and EquipmentGuide.
 * Its capacity-chart modal (CraneCapacityChart.tsx) and fleet data
 * (craneChartData.ts) were removed with it, since neither was used anywhere
 * else. The "Find Equipment" nav column that linked to it (navigation.ts)
 * was dropped too.
