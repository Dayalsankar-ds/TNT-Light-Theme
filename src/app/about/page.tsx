/**
 * /about — TNT's story, the family of companies, combined capability, reach
 * and safety. Built 2026-10-08 from the About Us master brief.
 *
 * Server component; only the timeline, company selector, capability list,
 * scroll CTA and hash handling are client islands. Every fact is sourced in
 * src/components/about/aboutData.ts.
 *
 * Section rhythm (no two adjacent sections alike): split hero (black panel
 * + photo) → white story → off-white family → white capabilities → black
 * reach (the one dark band) → grey safety → gold close.
 *
 * Outbound links all target homepage sections (/#services, /#coverage,
 * /#safety, /#quote) — there are no separate pages for those yet. Hero.tsx
 * skips its autoplay when the homepage is opened with a #hash, so these land
 * where they say.
 *
 * HERO IMAGE: /photos/about/about-hero-crawler-sunset.webp is 02.png from
 * the supplied TNT/Image folder (chosen on request). By inspection it's a
 * rendered still from the hero-video storyboard, not a photograph of a real
 * job — so its alt text describes the scene without claiming a project.

                  TNT Crane &amp; Rigging was founded in 1985 in Houston, Texas. In the decades that
