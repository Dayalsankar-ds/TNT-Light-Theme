/**
 * SECTION 5 — FULL-SCOPE CAPABILITY  (project lifecycle)
 *
 * REVERTED TO THE ICON-CARD DESIGN (2026-09-23, on request — a reference
 * screenshot: "FULL-SCOPE CAPABILITY" eyebrow, "ONE PARTNER, END TO END"
 * heading, 6 plain icon cards in a 3×2 grid, solid-amber closing CTA panel).
 * This replaces the "REAL SOLUTIONS FOR A HEAVIER TOMORROW" photo-card
 * redesign from 2026-09-22 (5 cards, real TNT photos, header tag list,
 * skewed CTA banner) — that version is still in git history
 * (`git show d44e684^:src/components/site/CoreServices.tsx` for the
 * pre-photo icon-card version this restores, or `git show
 * 9e69379^:src/components/site/CoreServices.tsx` for the photo-card
 * version this replaces) if either is ever wanted back instead.
 *
 * "ONE PARTNER, END TO END" is a genuine restoration, not just a copy of
 * the last icon-card version: that heading (with its own <RevealText>
 * animation) was removed entirely on 2026-09-11, before the photo-card
 * redesign ever happened. The reference screenshot shows it present, so
 * it's back here as a plain heading (no RevealText — that component's
 * animation was tied to copy this rewrite doesn't reintroduce elsewhere).
 *
 * SIX SERVICES, NOT FIVE: the 2026-09-22 redesign had dropped Wind Energy
 * after confirming against tntcrane.com that TNT's real, current service
 * list is five (Crane Rental, Specialized Rigging, Machinery Moving,
 * Industrial Storage, Engineering) — Wind Energy isn't one of them. The
 * reference screenshot for THIS restoration shows Wind Energy as card 06,
 * so it's back here on request; navigation.ts's Services panel was updated
 * to match (see that file's own note). Flagging the tension rather than
 * quietly resolving it: this section and the nav now show a service that
 * tntcrane.com's own site doesn't list.
 *
 * CRANE RENTAL KEEPS ITS DEDICATED PAGE: unlike the rest of this restored
 * design, Crane Rental's card still links to `/crane-rental` (added
 * 2026-09-18, its own real sub-page) via next/link's <Link>, not a plain
 * <a> — a plain <a> was measured forcing a full page reload instead of
 * Next's client-side route swap (see that page's own docblock). Every
 * other card still uses the shared `?service=...#quote` stretched-link
 * pattern, since none of them have a dedicated page.
 *
 * The lifecycle — LIFT → PLAN → RIG → MOVE → STORE → RENEWABLE — is carried
 * by the STAGE labels and the numbering, not by a drawn spine. Stage
 * numbering is JOURNEY order, and navigation.ts's Services panel matches —
 * the panel and this section are one numbering system or neither means
 * anything.
 *
 * THE GRID REINSTATES THE ANCHOR COLLISION a chained layout would avoid.
 * Three cards share a row, so /services#crane-rental and
 * /services#specialized-rigging resolve to the same scroll position.
 * <TargetHighlight> is what keeps the click legible — it outlines the
 * requested card even when the page cannot move. Do not remove it while
 * this layout stands.
 *
 * NO SHADOWS anywhere in this section, by request: depth is a hairline
 * border that goes gold, a 4%-opacity gold wash, and a 2px lift.
 *
 * Palette: black / white / gold. NOT navy — the brand book has no navy, and
 * the retired #071034 was removed site-wide on 2026-07-28.
 *
 * LIGHT ONLY: bg-white/text-black, black/N opacity utilities,
 * black-fill/amber-glyph icon-well hover. The site-wide Light/Dark toggle
 * (and this section's dark variant) was removed 2026-10-01, on request.
