/**
 * HERO — rebuilt 2026-10-01, on request, from new footage ("First clip.mp4" +
 * "Second clip.mp4", supplied directly), after the previous hero was removed
 * entirely on 2026-09-23 (see page.tsx's own history note).
 *
 * A REAL <video>, NOT A FRAME SEQUENCE (2026-10-01, on request — "I want
 * smooth output"): this first shipped as WebP frame sequences — frames-v7
 * (578 frames, 1280px/q75, 39MB) then frames-v8 (289 frames, 1024px/q55,
 * 9.6MB) — with an <img> whose `src` was swapped from a rAF loop. Even v8
 * still hitched: every swap is a main-thread image decode, and the whole
 * sequence had to download before playback could start. Now both clips are
 * joined into one H.264 MP4 (public/video/hero.mp4, 1920×1080, 60fps,
 * CRF 26, 3.7MB, +faststart), which the browser's hardware decoder plays on
 * its own compositor clock — no per-frame JS at all. Encoded from the source
 * MP4s with ffmpeg:
 *
 *   ffmpeg -i "First clip.mp4" -i "Second clip.mp4" -filter_complex \
 *     "[0:v]setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a];[1:v]trim=end_frame=312,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[b];
 *      [a][b]concat=n=2:v=1:a=0,setpts='<SPEED_EXPR>',fps=60,
 *      scale=1920:1080:flags=lanczos,format=yuv420p[v]" \
 *     -map "[v]" -an -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 26 -profile:v high \
 *     -level 4.2 -movflags +faststart hero.mp4
 *
 *   where <SPEED_EXPR> is (N = source frame index, 0–576; clip 2 starts at
 *   265):
 *
 *     if(lt(N,48),N,if(lt(N,68),48+20*log(1+(N-48)/20),
 *     if(lt(N,208),48+20*log(2)+(N-68)/2,
 *     if(lt(N,228),118+20*log(2)+20*log(2/(2-(N-208)/20)),
 *     if(lt(N,265),118+40*log(2)+(N-228),
 *     if(lt(N,285),155+40*log(2)+20*log(1+(N-265)/20),
 *     if(lt(N,529),155+60*log(2)+(N-285)/2,
 *     277+60*log(2)+(48/1.4)*log(2/(2-1.4*(N-529)/48)))))))))/110/TB
 *
 * `trim=end_frame=312` drops clip 2's final frame (the held TNT-logo card —
 * see AUTO-SCROLL below); <SPEED_EXPR> bakes in the playback speed,
 * including the crane-rotation and clip 2 speed changes (see PLAYBACK SPEED
 * below). With no speed changes it would simply be `setpts=PTS*24/110`.
 * hero-poster.webp is the video's first frame. Result: 196 frames, 3.27s.
 *
 * FULLY AUTOMATED, NOT SCROLL-DRIVEN (on request — "I don't want have user
 * interaction while playing. Every thing automated from first frame to last
 * frame. User can experience only one time. After that they need to reload
 * the site to experience it again"): no scroll interaction of any kind — the
 * section is a normal single-viewport-height block. The video is muted +
 * playsInline (what every browser requires for autoplay), plays once (no
 * `loop`), and starts on `canplaythrough` so it doesn't stall partway. A
 * reload plays it again from the start; there is no replay affordance.
 *
 * AUTOPLAY BLOCKED → FRAME-SEQUENCE FALLBACK (2026-10-01, on request —
 * "There is no movement on Hero section Video!" / "It stays in first frame"):
 * Safari in macOS/iOS Low Power Mode refuses autoplay even for muted
 * video, and the first video version also waited on `canplaythrough`, which
 * Safari may never fire when it isn't allowed to preload — so the poster
 * just sat there. Now `play()` is called directly (it starts the load on its
 * own), and if it rejects, the hero falls back to the previous WebP frame
 * sequence (public/video/frames-v11: every frame of hero.mp4 — 196 frames,
 * 1024px/q55, 7.4MB — stepped at 60fps by a rAF loop swapping an <img> over
 * the poster; regenerated, under a new name, each time the speed changes
 * below — it was frames-v8, then frames-v10). A JS-driven
 * image swap isn't subject to autoplay policy, so that path always moves.
 * The frames are only fetched on that fallback path — browsers that play the
 * video never download them. Both paths end in the same auto-scroll +
 * collapse.
 *
 * STREAMED FALLBACK (2026-10-01, on request — "There is a hold before
 * starting to play"): the fallback first shipped preloading every frame
 * before showing any movement — ~3.1s at 50Mbps, and longer on a Mac in Low
 * Power Mode, which also throttles network and decode. Now frames load in
 * order, LOAD_CONCURRENCY at a time, and playback starts as soon as the
 * measured download rate says the rest will arrive before they're due:
 * (frames still to load ÷ recent frames/ms) ≤ the full playback duration,
 * with a floor of MIN_START_BUFFER frames. A fixed 60-frame buffer was
 * tried first and cost ~0.9s at 50Mbps — a connection that delivers frames
 * ~3× faster than playback consumes them needs almost no head start, while
 * a slow one now waits just long enough instead. The rest keep loading
 * during playback; if the next
 * frame isn't loaded yet, the timeline holds on the last loaded one
 * (shifting the start time forward) rather than skipping ahead, so a slow
 * connection briefly pauses instead of jumping.
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION: under `prefers-reduced-motion` neither path runs — the
 * hero rests on its first frame and nothing auto-scrolls. Because the video
 * carries `autoPlay` (see the video-path effect), it may have begun before
 * hydration; the effect pauses and rewinds it, so at most a fraction of a
 * second plays first.
 *
 * FULL-BLEED UNDER THE FIXED NAV (2026-10-01, on request — "I can see dark
 * space on the top of this video clip"): this first shipped sitting inside
 * <main>'s normal `pt-[var(--chrome-h)]` nav clearance, which read as a
 * solid dark band above the footage instead of video running the full
 * height of the viewport. Reverted to the pre-removal placement instead —
 * page.tsx's wrapper cancels that padding (`-mt-[var(--chrome-h)] bg-black`)
 * so this section starts at true y=0, with `.glass-nav`'s own translucent,
 * backdrop-blurred fixed bar (SiteNav.tsx) floating over it exactly as it
 * did before. `h-screen` here (not the shorter mobile-specific height this
 * used at first) matches that full-bleed placement.
 *
 * PLAYBACK SPEED (2026-10-01, on request, across five rounds — "increase
 * the speed of this video" → … → "I want full speed on both clip"): both
 * clips ended up at 110fps from 24fps footage, i.e. ~4.58× real time,
 * ~5.25s total. That speed is baked into hero.mp4 itself (<SPEED_EXPR>
 * above), so the element plays at a normal playbackRate of 1.
 *
 * CRANE-ROTATION SPEED-UP (2026-10-05, on request — "Increase the speed on
 * crane rotating part on first clip"; a 2× speed-up around the clip merge
 * was tried first the same day and reverted): clip 1's crane rotation —
 * source frames ~48 (boom starts swinging toward the camera) to ~228 (it
 * settles pointing right at sunset), found from contact sheets — plays at
 * 2× the base speed, easing in and out over 20 frames each side so it
 * doesn't jolt: 0–47 at 1×; 48–67 ramp 1×→2×; 68–207 at 2×; 208–227 ramp
 * 2×→1×; 228–576 at 1×. Each ramp is linear in speed, so its timestamps are
 * the log integral in <SPEED_EXPR>. Measured by matching every output frame
 * back to its source frame: 1× until 0.43s, 2× through the rotation, back
 * to 1× from 1.32s; clip 2 now starts at 1.67s (was 2.42s); 4.50s total
 * (was 5.25s). Changing it means re-encoding hero.mp4 AND regenerating the
 * frames fallback from the new file (every frame, 1024px, WebP q55, under a
 * new frames-vN name so browsers can't serve stale cached frames).
 *
 * CLIP 2 SPEED-UP, SLOW FINISH (2026-10-06, on request — "increase the speed
 * on second clip make little slow on few end frame"): on top of the
 * rotation speed-up above, clip 2 eases up to 2× over its first 20 frames
 * (265–284), plays at 2× through 285–528, then eases DOWN over its last 48
 * frames (529–576) from 2× to 0.6× — slower than the base speed — so the
 * shot settles gently before the auto-scroll instead of cutting off at full
 * speed. Measured the same way: clip 1 unchanged, clip 2 still starts at
 * 1.67s, 2× until ~2.9s, then the slow finish; 3.27s total (was 4.50s).
 *
 * AUTO-SCROLL ON COMPLETION, SKIPPING THE TRUE LAST FRAME (2026-10-01, on
 * request — "auto scroll up to nav bar visible. User no need to see last
 * frame of second clip"): the held TNT-logo card is cut out of hero.mp4 at
 * encode time (`trim=end_frame=312`), and the video's `ended` event fires
 * `scrollToFamilyStrip()` immediately rather than holding on the last
 * frame.
 *
 * LANDING SPOT, BACK AND FORTH (2026-10-01, same day, three requests in a
 * row): first landed on #family (FamilyStripV2, the logo strip right under
 * the hero) — the same spot the OLD hero's useHeroAutoScroll.ts used. Then
 * moved to #statement ("About Us"), on request ("just scroll to about us
 * section, no need to stop there [at Family]") — landing on the short
 * Family strip read as the scroll stalling partway rather than going
 * anywhere. Then moved BACK to #family, on request ("can we stop the auto
 * scroll on TNT Family of company section?") — so #family is the landing
 * spot again, same as the very first version; the intervening #statement
 * target was not kept. SiteNav.tsx's own reveal check also watches
 * #family's position directly, so landing there is the simplest case for
 * the nav to reveal correctly — no "is the next section far enough past
 * #family" reasoning needed the way the #statement version required.
 *
 * Driven by `getLenis()` (SmoothScroll.tsx) — the same "drive the scroll
 * programmatically" escape hatch useHeroAutoScroll.ts used — falling back
 * to a plain `window.scrollTo` under reduced motion / before Lenis has
 * booted.
 *
 * HERO COLLAPSES AFTER LANDING (2026-10-01, on request — "remove the scroll
 * back to hero section final frame... automatically stop at TNT Crane family
 * of companies section"): replaces the earlier scroll-listener WALL, which
 * clamped scrollY back up after the fact. That version had two holes: it only
 * armed from Lenis's `onComplete`, so a wheel/touch during the 1.2s
 * auto-scroll (which interrupts it) left it permanently unarmed; and the
 * "Home" nav link (/#top) still scrolled straight back onto the frozen last
 * frame. Clamping after each scroll event could also flash a sliver of the
 * hero before snapping back.
 *
 * Now, once the post-playback scroll lands (or COLLAPSE_FALLBACK_MS passes,
 * covering the interrupted case), the section shrinks to a black spacer of
 * exactly LANDING_OFFSET px and, in the same layout pass, scrollY is shifted
 * up by the height that was removed — so the view doesn't move at all. The
 * top of the document IS the landing spot from then on: scrolling up just
 * stops there with nothing to bounce off, and /#top lands there too. The
 * spacer keeps #family's top at the same LANDING_OFFSET from the viewport
 * top as the auto-scroll left it (tucked `LANDING_MARGIN` under the bar,
 * past SiteNav.tsx's REVEAL_AT line), so the nav stays revealed. A reload
 * restores the full hero and plays it again, per the one-time-playback spec.
