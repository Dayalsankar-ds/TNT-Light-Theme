/**
 * HERO — rebuilt 2026-10-01, on request, from new footage ("First clip.mp4" +
 * "Second clip.mp4", supplied directly), after the previous hero was removed
 * entirely on 2026-09-23 (see page.tsx's own history note). Converted to a
 * 578-frame WebP sequence (public/video/frames-v7, 1280px wide) and merged by
 * continuous frame numbering (clip 1 = 00000–00264, clip 2 picks up at
 * 00265) rather than two separate sequences, so playback reads as one
 * continuous shot.
 *
 * QUALITY (2026-10-01, on request — "increase the quality of this video
 * clip"): re-encoded at WebP q75 (up from the old hero pipeline's q40 this
 * first shipped with) — same 1280px width and frame count, just less
 * compression per frame. 39MB total, up from 25MB. Width wasn't raised to
 * the 1918px source resolution in the same pass — that alone would roughly
 * 2.25x the payload on top of the quality bump, which is a separate,
 * heavier tradeoff than "look less compressed" calls for.
 *
 * FULLY AUTOMATED, NOT SCROLL-DRIVEN (on request — "I don't want have user
 * interaction while playing. Every thing automated from first frame to last
 * frame. User can experience only one time. After that they need to reload
 * the site to experience it again"): this is NOT the old hero's
 * scroll-scrubbed pin (590vh section, frame position tied to scroll offset,
 * HeroFrameGL/WebGL, useHeroAutoScroll claiming the scroll itself). There is
 * no scroll interaction of any kind here — the section is a normal
 * single-viewport-height block, and playback is pure elapsed time: all 578
 * frames preload, then a single rAF loop steps through them at the
 * source's own 24fps (~24s total) the moment they're ready, stopping dead on
 * the last frame rather than looping. A user who reloads gets the play
 * through again from frame 0 (a fresh mount re-preloads and restarts); one
 * who doesn't reload is left looking at the final frame (the TNT logo
 * reveal) — there is no replay affordance by design, per the request above.
 *
 * A single <img> tag has its `src` swapped each tick rather than a canvas —
 * every frame is already a preloaded, cache-resident Image() object by the
 * time playback starts, so each swap is a cache hit, not a network request.
 * `object-cover` handles the crop/scale, so there's no manual draw-rect math
 * the way the old canvas-based HeroFrameGL needed.
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION: skips the sequence entirely and shows frame 0 as a static
 * poster — no preloading of the other 577 frames, no rAF loop. No "poster
 * mode" for low-end devices/coarse pointers the way the old hero had
 * (scrub vs. poster vs. reduced): the old distinction existed because
 * scroll-scrubbing WebGL was the expensive part, and nothing here scrubs —
 * swapping a 1280px img.src 24 times a second is comfortably cheap on any
 * device this site otherwise supports. Read into a ref, not state — it only
 * ever gates which branch the mount effect takes, never what JSX renders, so
 * there's nothing for a re-render to accomplish (same pattern
 * EquipmentGuide.tsx's `reducedMotionRef` uses for its own autoplay gate).
 *
 * `ready` becomes true via `requestAnimationFrame`/image `onload` callbacks,
 * never synchronously inside an effect body — `react-hooks/set-state-in-
 * effect` flags the latter (a same-tick setState cascades an extra render),
 * and deferring by one frame is invisible here regardless.
 *
 * FULL-BLEED UNDER THE FIXED NAV (2026-10-01, on request — "I can see dark
 * space on the top of this video clip"): this first shipped sitting inside
 * <main>'s normal `pt-[var(--chrome-h)]` nav clearance, which read as a
 * solid dark band above the footage instead of video running the full
 * height of the viewport. Reverted to the pre-removal placement instead —
 * page.tsx's wrapper cancels that padding (`-mt-[var(--chrome-h)] bg-black`)
 * so this section starts at true y=0, with `.glass-nav`'s own translucent,
 * backdrop-blurred fixed bar (SiteNav.tsx) floating over it exactly as it
 * did before. `h-screen` here (not the shorter mobile-specific height this
 * used at first) matches that full-bleed placement.
 *
 * PLAYBACK SPEED, PER CLIP (2026-10-01, on request, across five rounds —
 * "increase the speed of this video" → "increase the more speed on second
 * clip only" → "still increase the speed of the second clip" → "increase
 * the speed of the first clip too, I want full speed on both clip"): the
 * first request raised a single uniform `PLAYBACK_FPS` 24 → 40. The next
 * two asked for clip 2 specifically faster than clip 1, taking it 40 → 70 →
 * 110 while clip 1 stayed at 40. The last request caught clip 1 back up to
 * match — both `CLIP1_FPS` and `CLIP2_FPS` are 110 now, i.e. uniformly
 * fast rather than clip 1 being the slow half. The split into two named
 * constants (rather than going back to one shared `PLAYBACK_FPS`) is
 * deliberate even though the values are equal right now — keeping them
 * separate is what makes "just clip 2" or "just clip 1" a one-line change
 * again if a future request asks for that split back.
 * `frameIndexForElapsed()` is the one place that piecewise timing lives;
 * CLIP_SPLIT marks where the merged sequence's numbering crosses from clip
 * 1 into clip 2 (see the merge note above).
 *
 * AUTO-SCROLL ON COMPLETION, SKIPPING THE TRUE LAST FRAME (2026-10-01, on
 * request — "auto scroll up to nav bar visible. User no need to see last
 * frame of second clip"): playback never actually shows frame 577 (the held
 * TNT-logo card) — `LAST_VISIBLE_FRAME` caps the displayed index one frame
 * short of it, and the instant elapsed time would reach the end,
 * `scrollToFamilyStrip()` fires immediately rather than holding on whatever
 * frame is showing.
 *
 * LANDING SPOT, BACK AND FORTH (2026-10-01, same day, three requests in a
 * row): first landed on #family (FamilyStripV2, the logo strip right under
 * the hero) — the same spot the OLD hero's useHeroAutoScroll.ts used. Then
 * moved to #statement ("About Us"), on request ("just scroll to about us
 * section, no need to stop there [at Family]") — landing on the short
 * Family strip read as the scroll stalling partway rather than going
 * anywhere. Then moved BACK to #family, on request ("can we stop the auto
 * scroll on TNT Family of company section?") — so #family is the landing
 * spot again, same as the very first version; the intervening #statement
 * target was not kept. SiteNav.tsx's own reveal check also watches
 * #family's position directly, so landing there is the simplest case for
 * the nav to reveal correctly — no "is the next section far enough past
 * #family" reasoning needed the way the #statement version required.
 *
 * Driven by `getLenis()` (SmoothScroll.tsx) — the same "drive the scroll
 * programmatically" escape hatch useHeroAutoScroll.ts used — falling back
 * to a plain `window.scrollTo` under reduced motion / before Lenis has
 * booted.
 *
 * HERO COLLAPSES AFTER LANDING (2026-10-01, on request — "remove the scroll
 * back to hero section final frame... automatically stop at TNT Crane family
 * of companies section"): replaces the earlier scroll-listener WALL, which
 * clamped scrollY back up after the fact. That version had two holes: it only
 * armed from Lenis's `onComplete`, so a wheel/touch during the 1.2s
 * auto-scroll (which interrupts it) left it permanently unarmed; and the
 * "Home" nav link (/#top) still scrolled straight back onto the frozen last
 * frame. Clamping after each scroll event could also flash a sliver of the
 * hero before snapping back.
 *
 * Now, once the post-playback scroll lands (or COLLAPSE_FALLBACK_MS passes,
 * covering the interrupted case), the section shrinks to a black spacer of
 * exactly LANDING_OFFSET px and, in the same layout pass, scrollY is shifted
 * up by the height that was removed — so the view doesn't move at all. The
 * top of the document IS the landing spot from then on: scrolling up just
 * stops there with nothing to bounce off, and /#top lands there too. The
 * spacer keeps #family's top at the same LANDING_OFFSET from the viewport
 * top as the auto-scroll left it (tucked `LANDING_MARGIN` under the bar,
 * past SiteNav.tsx's REVEAL_AT line), so the nav stays revealed. A reload
 * restores the full hero and plays it again, per the one-time-playback spec.
