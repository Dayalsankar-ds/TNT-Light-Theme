/**
 * SITE NAV — added onto the Hero, not into it.
 *
 * Rendered as a fixed sibling above <HeroScrollExperience /> in page.tsx, so
 * the locked hero markup is never touched.
 *
 * Frosted dark glass (.glass-nav): translucent slate + backdrop-blur, so the
 * hero and sections blur through the bar. The tint is held dark enough (0.7)
 * that white nav text stays legible over the light sections below; a heavier
 * shadow drops in once scrolled. Degrades to solid slate where backdrop-filter
 * is unsupported (see globals.css).
 *
 * Visibility: on the HOMEPAGE only, the bar hides over the hero and is shown
 * once #family (the Family Strip, first section after the hero) reaches the
 * top of the viewport. A rAF loop reads that section's position each frame, so it
 * stays in sync under the hero's transform-based smooth-scroll (window `scroll`
 * events are unreliable). On every other route there is no hero, so the bar is
 * always visible — the check is gated on the pathname, not merely on the
 * target existing, so reusing the section on another route can't hide the bar.
 *
 * The toggle is instant, not animated: `.glass-nav` uses `backdrop-filter`,
 * which pushes opacity/transform transitions onto the main thread, and this
 * page's scroll rAF loops starve them (a CSS transition here freezes mid-fade).
 * The mega panels below open instantly for the same reason — they are children
 * of the glass header, so a fade on them stutters exactly the same way.
 *
 * STRUCTURE (2026-07-28). The bar carried nine flat links plus a phone number
 * and a CTA — eleven items, which is why the desktop layout could not engage
 * until `xl`. It now carries four group triggers (see navigation.ts), each
 * opening a panel that exposes the site's ~23 real destinations. Triggers are
 * real <Link>s to the group's own landing page, so the panel is an enhancement
 * and never the only route in — keyboard and no-JS users still get there.
